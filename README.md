# CTL-FinalProject

<b>Intro/Overview:</b>
As the final class project for Coding the Law at Suffolk University Law School, we were tasked with creating a technical solution for a real-world legal problem. After thinking through the logistics and obvious hurdles of finding an external partner in the middle of a pandemic, my teammates, Joelle and Mike, and I chose to work with the Document Assembly Line Project and Suffolk LitLab. We produced three automated interviews for Mass Legal Services, the Boston Housing Authority and a General Release Form. 

Third party authorizations are common practice in the legal field to allow attorneys to acess the protected private information of their clients. These forms are often filled out during in-person consultations or meetings between the client and attorney. Due to the challenges of COVID-19 limiting safe access to in-person client meetings, these online interviews streamline the completion of these forms to be returned to the attorneys for use.

Prior to these interviews, each of the forms could be downloaded, printed, filled out, and returned to their respective attorney or agency. With COVID-19 bringing strict limitations to in person meetings these interviews allow for a user-friendly solution to completing these forms swiftly. These interviews will help the user, attorney or agency involved as they will have completed forms for use dispite the challanges that COVID-19 has brought this year. 

As a group Joelle Ataya, Mike Carrol and I worked to complete three release forms requested by the Document Assembly Line Project. In our initial pitch, we only focused on two forms, the Attorney Authorization for Release from <a href="https://masslegalservices.org">Mass. Legal Services</a> in English and Spanish and the Authorization for Release from <a href="https://https://bostonhousing.org/en/Home.aspx">Boston Housing Authority</a>. Looking at the challenges that creating and translating an interview to a language that none of us were fluent in, we decided to pivot our initial MVP to be solely the english forms. At the request of our external partner, we added a third interview for a General Release Form. Since we now had three forms, each of us took point on one form. Kayla for the Mass. Legal Services Authorization, Mike for the BHA Authorization, and Joelle for the General Release form.
